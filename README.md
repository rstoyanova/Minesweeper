# :bomb: Minesweeper

The game is played on a square board and the player has to click on the cells which do not have a mine. And obviously he doesn't know where the mines are. If a cell where a mine is present is clicked then he loses, else he is still in the game until all safe cells are revealed and in this case he wins.  

At the beginning of the game, the user should be able to select the level of difficulty of the game.  
``
Choose your level of difficulty:
    -Beginner /9x9 board, 10 mines/
    -Intermediate /16x16 board, 40 mines/
    -Advanced /24x24 board, 40 mines/
